                <p>Many of the worlds water falls are accessible by foot paths. Some are obvious, such as national park trails, while some are hidden off the beaten path. Not all waterfalls are Niagara Falls' level events. Some waterfalls are small. To be considered a waterfall, it must be at least 5 feet high.
